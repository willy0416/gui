Slots receive signals
Signals can send data regarding what just happened
You can connect Qt widgets directly to one another rather than using a signal-handling function
---
Mouse move events are only registered if the mouse is pressed, unless you have set self.setMouseTracking(True)
Typically to register a click from a user you should watch for both the mouse down and the release
---
Context menus appear when right-clicking on a window
---
You can trigger default behavior with super() parent implementation and subsequently intercept the event
Parent of a widget in the context of the layout is found by .parent()
Events are passed to the uppermost widget in the UI (i.e. if you click a button in a window, the button receives the event first)
Event bubbles up until it can be handled or reaches the main window
Can mark an event as handled in an event handler by calling e.accept() or unhandled by e.ignore() to bubble up
