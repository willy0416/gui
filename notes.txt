QApplication class holds the event loop (only 1 instance required)
qapp_instance.exec_() begins event loop
Pass in sys.argv when initializing QApplication to use command-line args, otherwise use []

Every app needs at least one QMainWindow (app exits when last main window is closed)
Write your own Window class that inherits from QMainWindow
Must window.show(), otherwise the window will be invisible
